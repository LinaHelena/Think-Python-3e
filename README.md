# Think-Python-3e
Think Python 3e by Allen B. Downey.

#This repository contains my chapter-by-chapter Jupyter notebooks as I work through Think Python, an introduction to Python programming for beginners. The book introduces concepts step-by-step, from basic syntax to recursion and object-oriented programming. Each notebook corresponds to a single chapter and includes code examples, exercises, and my notes. The goal is to reinforce learning by practicing and documenting my understanding as I go.

Chapter 4 exercises don’t display on GitHub because they use Colab’s jupyturtle module, which isn’t supported outside Colab
